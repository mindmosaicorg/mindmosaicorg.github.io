    <h1>About Mind Mosaic</h1>

    <p>
       Mind Mosaic is a small project dedicated to lifelong learning.
      We focus on voice-first and screen-light tools that make it easier
      to reflect and understand, especially for those who are vision-challenged
      or simply want to reduce screen time.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now, our content is available on Alexa.
      We're planning to add Substack soon, and may expand to YouTube in the future.
      Everything is created with care, free to access, and meant to support thoughtful learning.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Care</h2>

      <p>
        This all started when my father began to lose his vision.
        I kept wondering how people like him could keep learning
        if reading became harder.
        He had subscribed to science journals his whole life,
        and that helped inspire my interest in physics and learning in general.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been thinking about this ever since.
        I wanted to find a way to share real science and helpful ideas
        in a form that doesn't rely on screens.
        That’s what led to Mind Mosaic.

      <h2>How We're Funded</h2>

      <p>
        Mind Mosaic isn't a business.
        It's something we created because we care about learning and accessibility.
        There are no ads or paywalls.
        If you choose to donate, it helps cover hosting and future development.
        If anything remains, we’ll pass it on to causes we believe in.

      </p>
